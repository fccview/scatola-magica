## How to contribute

Hi, it's amazing having a community willing to push new feature to the app, and I am VERY open to contributors pushing their idea, it's what makes open source amazing.

That said for the sake of sanity let's all follow the same structure:

- Please if you use AI, make sure to clean up the code and don't leave obvious bloat. You can help yourself with a [little tool I built](https://fccview.github.io/ackchyually-ai/) to make sure code is properly reviewed.
- Use pre-existing components, keep styling consistent, please don't hardcode html classes/inline styling, especially if a component alraedy exists.
- When creating a new branch, do off from the `develop` branch, this will always be ahead of `main` and it's what gets released.
- When creating a pull request, direct it back into `develop`, I' ll then review it and merge it. Your code will end up in the next release that way and we all avoid conflicts!

Please bear with on reviews, it may take a bit of time for me to go through it all on top of life/work/hobbies :)
